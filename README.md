<p align="center">This project is a cell growth simulation web application built using React and TypeScript. The application allows users to simulate cell growth over time on a grid. Users can start, pause, and reset the simulation, adjust the interval speed, and change the grid size dynamically. The application also includes a growth chart to visualize the number of occupied cells over time.

### Features

- Interactive grid where users can toggle cells between occupied and unoccupied states.
- Simulation of cell growth based on adjacent cells.
- Dynamic adjustment of simulation speed (interval).
- Ability to change the grid size.
- Growth chart to visualize the cell growth over time.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

### Key Components

- App.tsx: The main component that sets up the grid, controls, and growth chart. It manages the state of the simulation, including the grid, running state, interval, and growth rate.
- Grid.tsx: A component that renders the grid and handles cell click events.
- Cell.tsx: A component that represents a single cell in the grid.
- Controls.tsx: A component that provides controls to start, pause, reset the simulation, and change the interval speed and grid size.
- GrowthChart.tsx: A component that renders the growth chart showing the number of occupied cells over time.
- useInterval.ts: A custom hook that sets up an interval to run the simulation.
- App.css: The main CSS file for styling the application.

### Assumptions and Additional Features

## Assumptions
The initial grid size is set to 20x20.
The simulation logic for cell growth is based on randomly occupying adjacent empty cells.

## Additional Features
Performance optimization for larger grid sizes.
Enhanced visualization for the growth chart.
Saving and loading the simulation state.
Mobile-friendly design improvements.
